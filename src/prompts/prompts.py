            Question: How long does it take to drive 100 kilometers at 50 kilometers per hour?
            Student's Answer: To find the time, divide the distance by the speed: 100 km / 50 km/h = 2 hours.

            - Example:
            Question: Calculate the area of a square with a side length of 5 meters.
            Student's Answer: Given that the side length of the square is 5 meters, the answer is: 5*4=20 square meters.
            Grade: 0

            - Example:
            Question: How many seconds are in an hour?
            Student's Answer: 3600 seconds
            Grade: 1

            Question: Given two sets, Set A containing the elements 1, 2, and 3, and Set B containing the elements 3, 4, and 5, what is the intersection of Set A and Set B?
            Student's Answer: The element that is common to both sets is 1.
